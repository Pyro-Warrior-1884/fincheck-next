Welcome to the technical documentation for **Fincheck** —
a confidence-aware digit validation system for financial documents.

This documentation covers:

- Risk-aware evaluation metrics
- Experimental methodology and reproducibility

Fincheck reframes handwritten digit recognition as a **risk evaluation problem**
rather than an accuracy optimization task.
